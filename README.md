# Predictive_Analytics_For_Loan_Default_Using_DeepLearning
The Deep Learning Loan Default Prediction project aims to create a predictive model that assesses loan default likelihood. By leveraging deep learning techniques, it trains a neural network to analyze features from loan applicants, including credit history, income, employment status, and other financial indicators.

Deep Learning Loan Default Prediction

Project Overview

The Advanced Deep Learning Loan Default Prediction project aims to build a robust predictive model to assess the likelihood of loan defaults. Utilizing deep learning techniques, this project focuses on training a neural network to analyze various features from loan applicants, such as their credit history, income levels, employment status, and other financial indicators.

Objectives

Predict Loan Defaults: The primary goal is to accurately predict whether a client will default on their loan payment based on historical data.
Data Analysis: Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between different variables and their impact on loan defaults.
Model Building: Develop and optimize a deep learning model using the training dataset, ensuring it generalizes well to unseen data.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.
Datasets

The project utilizes two datasets:

Train Dataset: Contains historical loan data used for model training and evaluation.
Test Dataset: Used for testing the model's predictions, with results submitted to the Hackathon platform for evaluation.
Metrics

The model's performance will be measured based on accuracy, defined as the percentage of correct predictions (True Positives + True Negatives) out of the total observations in the dataset.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
